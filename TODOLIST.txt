Since this assignment is to record data, it records questions
So in the future with all custom questions, add them to a array or something/file, then make them retrievable

For part 1 and showcae:
1. Editing a quiz will require a new modal
1.5 Then use that in a quiz, pass as observable to the quiz-page

2. Get score accumulated to be added to users and users guess ([correctCount, incorrectCount])

3. At the end of a quiz, nav to a page which says the stats of the game, plus the total earned from the game...

4. Implement the other quizzes


Milestone 2:
1. Get score to save to file, possibly keep users on the file
2. Charts and cool stuff
3. Get other users to answer questions...

Save for full game, for now...:
- Profile editing
- Timed quizzes
